    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Gulab Jamun</strong> is a popular Indian dessert made of milk solids, sugar, and flour. The sweet dough is shaped into small balls, deep-fried until golden brown, and then soaked in a fragrant rose-flavored sugar syrup. Gulab Jamun is traditionally made with **khoya** (reduced milk), although modern versions often use milk powder or ready-made Gulab Jamun mix.
