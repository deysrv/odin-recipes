    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Rosogolla</strong> (also known as <strong>Rasgulla</strong>) is a popular Bengali sweet made from fresh <strong>chhena</strong> (Indian cottage cheese) and <strong>sugar syrup</strong>. The preparation begins by making chhena from fresh cow’s milk, which is curdled using lemon juice or vinegar. The curdled milk is then drained and the whey is separated, leaving behind soft, crumbly chhena. This chhena is kneaded thoroughly to form a smooth, pliable dough. Small, round balls are then shaped from this dough, ensuring there are no cracks, as they need to hold their shape while cooking.

        <p>The chhena balls are then gently boiled in a sugar syrup made with water and sugar. The key to a perfect Rosogolla is the cooking technique—it's important to cook the balls at a gentle simmer to allow them to puff up and absorb the syrup without breaking apart. Once they are cooked and have doubled in size, they are allowed to cool and soak in the syrup, which gives them their signature sweet, spongy texture. The result is a soft, syrupy treat that melts in your mouth, loved for its delicate balance of sweetness and the richness of the chhena. Rasgullas are often served chilled and are a festive treat, especially during celebrations like Durga Puja or Diwali in India.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh whole milk</li>
        <li>Lemon juice or vinegar (to curdle the milk)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cardamom (optional, for flavor)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>      
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the milk in a large pan until it comes to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice or vinegar gradually to curdle the milk. Stir gently to separate the curds and whey.</li>
        <li>Once the milk has curdled, drain the whey using a muslin cloth or cheesecloth, leaving the chhena (curds) behind.</li>
        <li>Place the chhena in a bowl and knead it thoroughly for about 5-10 minutes to form a smooth, pliable dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small, smooth balls, ensuring there are no cracks.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sugar syrup by boiling water and sugar together until the sugar dissolves completely. Optionally, add cardamom for flavor.</li>
        <li>Carefully drop the chhena balls into the boiling syrup. Let them cook for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat, until they puff up and absorb the syrup.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the balls from the syrup and let them cool for a while before serving.</li>
      </ol>
